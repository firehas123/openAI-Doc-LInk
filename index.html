SANJOG’S PROFILE

1.	Introduction:
Established in 2006, Sanjog has been working with a vision statement “every human is free from all forms of abuse and exploitation” and a mission ‘to promote fundamental rights of marginalized through advocacy, capacity building and right based approach to service delivery’. The organization aims at ‘combating all forms of abuse and exploitations of human beings’. It works for the protection and promotion of human rights in general; however, specifically it targets most vulnerable groups of society such as children, women, minorities and persons with disabilities. The organization has a special focus on women- gender based violence, children accompanying their mother in the jail, juveniles in conflict with law, street children, survivors of sexual abuse and exploitation, trafficked and refugee children, and children of religious and ethnic minorities. Sanjog works at the national level.

It is important to note that being a right based organization; Sanjog does not believe in substituting governmental organizations by providing long term institutional care to its target population. Rather, its approach is to work hand-in-hand with governmental organizations, making the later realized for its duties. Whereas Sanjog is involved in service delivery, it is either in the form of action-research in order to understand the problem in-depth or to build a model intervention for concerned governmental organization.

Being rights-based organization, Sanjog believes in gender equality. Its director is a female.  Its board has female members and it has almost 50% female staff members.  Its team of probono lawyers consists of both genders.  Under its ‘no discrimination’ policy, Sanjog has staff members from different religious and ethnic back grounds Having this background, Sanjog’s all interventions keep particular eye on gender balance.

Sanjog is among the pioneering members of Child Rights Movement (CRM). It served as the CRM Punjab secretariat during the year 2012-13. Sanjog has been the member of CRM Executive Committee for three consecutive years from 2016 to 2018. Since the beginning of CRM, Sanjog was an active member and has contributed to vibrancy and cohesion of this great network.  It pledges to serve CRM in the future also to advocate for and promote children’s rights.

6. Sanjog’s Interventions: 
6.1 Child Rights Governance: 2013 to date
Since the promulgation of Juvenile Justice System Ordinance 2000, the proper implementation on this ordinance could not be done accordingly. For instance, police is directed to contact parents, guardians and probation officers when a child is arrested and kept in a police station. However, most of police has no awareness in this regard.  Judges are not sensitized either.  They grant judicial and physical remand in juvenile cases without keeping in mind the JJSO 2000.

Sanjog was committed to improve the juvenile justice system in Pakistan and was facilitating the probation department and judiciary in Punjab to promote the restorative justice instead of penalizing and detaining the children who come into conflict with law.

The project’s goal was “Protection of child’s legal rights through proper implementation of Juvenile Justice System Ordinance 2000” 

Later on project goal was “Protection of child’s legal rights through proper implementation of Juvenile Justice System Act 2018”.
Specific objectives were: 
•	Diversion mechanism for children in contact with law from formal justice system is in place utilized in target province.
•	Curriculum on Juvenile Justice and child rights developed and institutionalized at Police Training Centre in one province.
•	To enhance general knowledge of public regarding child legal rights and JJSA 2018. 

The following outcomes had been achieved so far:

•	The issue of juvenile justice has been kept alive with full dedication in a small budget
•	JJSO 2000 is inducted in the curriculum of police training institutes of Punjab.
•	45 Additional District and Session Judge, 77 Civil Judges, 18 Prosecutors, 82 Prison officers, 35 Lawyers and 12 Probation officers, 40 judicial magistrates, 577 Police Officers, and 10 crime reporters are trained on JJSO 2000, Probation Act, CP, CRC, relevant child related laws using the premises of Punjab Judicial Academy; National Academy for Prison Administration; Police Training College Chung, Lahore; Police Training College, Sihala; Attock Judiciary and Police Line Rawalpindi 
•	12 probation officers are trained on Social Investigation Reporting
•	Support and follow up of 633 cases. Out of which 340 cases disposed off and 160 bailed out  resultantly 141 juveniles released
•	8 Parliamentarians are sensitized from 3 major political parties on the issue of probation and for establishment of exclusive juvenile courts. Road map is prepared for them for drafting a bill on juvenile justice.  They are willing to present it in assembly to uplift probation department and for establishment of exclusive juvenile court.
•	Advocacy campaign is launched for establishment of exclusive Juvenile courts in Lahore district and separate trail of children in ATC. 19 district and session judges are sensitized through a seminar and general public through 4 walks and 4 press conferences.
•	6 Offices of Probation officers are renovated in Lahore, Sahiwal and Kasur.
•	FM radio messages, posters and manual on child related are disseminated to enhance general knowledge of public regarding child legal rights and JJSO 2000
•	Developing a Child rights education program for capacity building of members of civil society organizations
•	250 Lawyers, Lavies officers and probation officer are sensitized in Quetta, Mastung, Sariab, Ziarat Baluchistan and Abbottabad and Mansehra KP.

The project was financially supported by Save the Children, the Global fund for Children and currently funded by Vivere.

6.2	Children’s awareness on fatal effects of smoking, illicit drugs and alcohol: 2020 to date

Youngsters in Pakistan are the most affected by drugs and alcohol and the number of these addicts is increasing at the rate of 40,000 per year making Pakistan one of the most drug affected countries in the world. The most disturbing fact is that majority of heroin addicts in Pakistan are under the age of 24.
The growing trend of drug abuse in educational institutions has posed a serious threat to the lives and health of students as the college and university students use drugs freely and openly. According to one survey, one out of every 10 college/university students is a drug addict and almost 50 per cent students of different educational institutions are addicted to drugs
Head of Community Medicine at CMH Lahore Medical College Professor Dr. Muhammad Ashraf Chaudhry expressed that the widespread availability of drugs in Pakistan is making souls of youth lifeless and it is need of the hour to come up with effective measures to curb this menace (The News, 2018)
A recent survey of 10 colleges and two universities of Lahore brought to light some eye-opening facts related to drug abuse among students. The majority of students surveyed — 57 percent — reported using one or more drugs. 
Intervention includes:

a.	Awareness session with children at school and college level
b.	Parents are also involved in those sessions
c.	Follow up sessions with children

6.3 Legal Aid to Children in District Jail, Lahore: 2007 to date
Sanjog under its Legal Aid Program has been working in District jail, Lahore for providing legal aid to children in detention. Sanjog’s in house lawyers as well as pro-bono lawyers visit jails and identify children who need legal aid because either the family is unaware of the child’s detention or the family is not in a position to afford a lawyer for getting their child out of the jail. Sanjog after taking up the case pursues the case in the court(s) till the case is disposed off by the court.

Psychologist of Sanjog work with the children by providing them counseling inside the jails in form of individual counseling sessions similarly group counseling sessions are provided to tackle the issues in form of a group. Female psychologists visit the homes of the children before and after the child’s release from the jail for providing family counseling to the family for working out the issues which forced the child in committing an offence.

In most cases, the children in detention are either living on the street or working on the street in order to survive. Sanjog is aware of the dynamics of streets of Pakistan and reunifies the children once they are released from jails resulting from bail or after the ending of case. A social worker traces the family once the case is taken up for legal aid by Sanjog. The social worker and the psychologist follow up on each child from minimum of 3 to 6 months depending on the circumstances of each case.

Released children are provided vocational/ technical skill in order to empower them socio-economically and for improving their standard of living. Children are enrolled in partner government or private skill institutions for learning skills as these institutes provide relaxed rules for admission of these children.

633 Cases of juvenile were taken from District Jail of Lahore and provided services to them. 

This project has been financially supported by Groupe Developpement, the European Commission, Save the Children and most recently by the Global Children Fund.

Psychologist of Sanjog work with the children by providing them counseling inside the jails in form of individual counseling sessions similarly group counseling sessions are provided to tackle the issues in form of a group. Female psychologists visits the home of the children before and after the child’s release from the jail for providing family counseling to the family for working out the issues which forced the child in committing an offence.

In most cases the children in detention are either living on the street or working on the street in order to survive. Sanjog is aware of the dynamics of streets of Pakistan and reunifies the children once they are released from jails resulting from bail or after the ending of case. Social worker traces the family once the case is taken up for legal aid by Sanjog. Social worker and psychologist follow up on each child from minimum of 3 to 6 months depending on the circumstances of each case.

Released children are provided vocational/ technical skill in order to empower them socio-economically and for improving their standard of living. Children are enrolled in partner government or private skill institutions for learning skills as these institutes provide relaxed rules for admission of these children.  

This project was financially supported by Groupe Developpement.

6.14 Sanjog Theatre: 2007 to 2015
Theater is a powerful medium for presenting the ideas to the masses. Theater was used to show drama, music, comedy or tragedy and people related to these depending on their personal experiences. Interactive theater involves the audience as artists interact with audience by posing questions or seeking answers. Interactive theater takes the whole experience to another level where the interaction between the characters and the audience generates lasting impressions.
Children due to their innocence are easily able to imagine and perceive things with which adults have difficulty. Their creative power and ability to take risks, without being scared of the consequences, allows them to express and communicate their message in more meaningful manner, especially when these children are those who have faced these problems throughout their lives.  Through their performance they bring their own personal experiences which gives genuineness and personal touch to the interactive theater.
Sanjog has many years’ experience to mobilize a team of motivated youth from the vulnerable communities and provided them training in participatory theatre.  Many members of theater group were formerly Sanjog's peer educators that usually are from communities where Sanjog establishes child center to provide children with a safe environment in which they can learn skills and get non-formal education.

Sanjog Theatre group was dedicated to learn the art of theatre and to use it as a tool to create awareness on taboo subjects prevailing in communities. They had performed in places such as Madrassah, parking lots, courtyard, drop-in-centers and on special children days such as universal children's day and child sexual abuse prevention day on issues such as HIV/AIDS, gender violence, child sexual abuse, substance abuse and trafficking. The team often consisted of working youth, i.e. welders, car washers and rickshaw drivers.  Many theater performances had been done in different cities mainly Quetta, Islamabad, Karachi, and Lahore.  The group got many recognitions and awards.
